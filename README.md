# AutoPowerpointChart
Python programme to automate creation / formatting of native Powerpoint charts from an Excel data source. 

Native meaning the data is embedded within the Powerpoint file, so no Excel file is required to edit the chart data - great for distributing a standalone ppt as a deliverable report where readers might want to access data / edit charts.
